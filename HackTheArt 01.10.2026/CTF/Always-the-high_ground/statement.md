# Always-the-high_ground

He always has the high ground. Can't deny him that. Superb views as well from that high ground of his, overlooking glistening rivers in the sunlight and all the other good things that come from having the high ground. I'm curious, what was the name of that hotel or palace he visited out west, in a big city. He told me the location in three words I can't quite remember... Care to give me a helping hand?
