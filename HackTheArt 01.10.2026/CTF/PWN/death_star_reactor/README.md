# Death Star Reactor

## Category: Pwn

**Description:**

"That's no moon... it's a trap! The Empire left a backdoor in the Death Star's reactor controls. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to find the thermal exhaust port (aka the buffer overflow) and trigger the hidden `print_flag` function. May the shell be with you!"

**Flag Format:** `HCS{...}`
