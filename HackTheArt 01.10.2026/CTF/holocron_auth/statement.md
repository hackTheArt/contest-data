# Holocron Authentication

A Sith Holocron is locked, requiring a "Force Signature" to unlock its secrets. Analyze the provided binary to understand the authentication mechanism. You'll need to understand the `transform` logic and find the correct input to unlock the holocron and reveal the flag.

**Goal:** Bypass the Holocron's authentication to retrieve the flag.
