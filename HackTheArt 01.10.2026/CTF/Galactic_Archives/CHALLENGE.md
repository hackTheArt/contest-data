# Galactic Archives

## Description
The Rebels have intercepted a transmission pointing to an old Imperial Archive node (ID: 0X-1138). It's rumored to contain override codes for a secure facility, hidden deep within the database tables.

The interface is ancient, and the search droid seems to be running on legacy code. Can you penetrate the archives and retrieve the hidden `imperial_secrets`?

Your objective is to find the "Death_Star_Override" code.

## Hints
1. The search function looks for planet names.
2. The error messages are surprisingly detailed.
3. Maybe there are other tables besides `planets`?
