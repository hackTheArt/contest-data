# Droid Firmware

A KX-series security droid's firmware has been dumped. The flag is encrypted and mixed into the firmware using a custom pseudo-random number generator and XOR operations. Your task is to reverse engineer the firmware generation and flag embedding algorithm from the provided C source code to recover the hidden flag.

**Goal:** Reverse engineer the firmware to extract the flag.
