# Jedi Vacation

---

Finally, after many months in the Galactic Senate, at the forefront of the New Republic Government, Leia has decided to enjoy a long awaited vacation and the love machine known as Han Solo came along as well. They traveled to a far, far away planet named Terra, not known by many people where they embarked on a quite old-fashioned cruise. However, our intelligence agents report a more worrying reality. Your mission is this, ISB agent, figure out the precise location visited by the royal couple and relay your intel in the three-word system. As a head-start, this is the only image we have of the location, an image taken by one of our covert satellites.
