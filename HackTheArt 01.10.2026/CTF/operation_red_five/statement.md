# Operation Red Five

R2-D2 has encoded critical intelligence into a network transmission, but the Empire has deployed jamming signals. Analyze the provided `operation_red_five.pcap` file. The flag is hidden within the TCP sequence numbers of specific packets. You'll need to filter out the noise and reconstruct the flag.

**Goal:** Extract the flag from the PCAP by analyzing TCP traffic.
