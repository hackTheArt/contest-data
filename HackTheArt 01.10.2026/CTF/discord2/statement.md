# Discord2: Bot Command Injection

A seemingly innocent Discord bot provides network utility commands like `ping`, `dns`, `traceroute`, and `whois`. However, it has some security measures in place. Your goal is to find a way to bypass these measures and exploit the bot to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system to retrieve the flag.

**Goal:** Achieve command injection on the Discord bot.
