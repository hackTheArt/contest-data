# Operation Blind Spot

The Imperial Astromech Interface has been compromised by a "X-Wing Virus," which purges any input containing the character 'x'. Your mission is to recover weapon blueprints from `death_star_x_plans.txt` by writing a Rust subroutine, but without using the forbidden character 'x' anywhere in your code.

**Goal:** Read `death_star_x_plans.txt` without using the character 'x' in your Rust code.
